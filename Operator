Operator: In Java Programming Language there are some special symbols that are used to perform different types of operations with variables and values. These symbols are called Operator.

Operand: To whom operator operates.

There are different types of operators. -> 1. Arithmetic Operator
                                           2. Relational Operator
                                           3. Logical Operator
                                           4. Assignment Operator
                                           5. Bitwise Operator
                                           6. Ternary Operator




1. Arithmetic Operator: 1. Unary Operator: Unary operator operates with only one variable. -> 1. Prefix Unary Operator: ++x
                                                                                              2. Postfix Unary Operator: x++

                            i. Prefix: ++x, --x, ++5, --5
                            ii. Postfix: x++, x--, 5++, 5--


                          Difference Between Prefix and Postfix: 

                           int x = 5;
                           System.out.println(--x);  x = 4     //decrement by 1
                           System.out.println(x);    x = 4

                           int y = 5;
			   System.out.println(y++);  y = 5     //increment by 1
                           System.out.println(y);    y = 6



                        2. Binary Operator: Binary operator operates with two or multiple variables. > +, -, *, /, %
                          
                         int a = 10;       
                         int b = 15;
                         int c = a + b;      c = 25
			 int d = b - a;      d = 5
                         int m = a * b;      m = 150
                         int div = b / a;    div = 1
                         int mod = a % b;    mod = 10



2. Relational Operator: Relational Operators are used to compare operands. Relational operators are: >, >=, <, <=, !=, ==
                    
                        int age = 18;                          
                        if (age >= 18) {                      
			    System.out.println("Voter");
                        }

			boolean b = age >= 18;
			System.out.println(b);    b = true

			int x  = 10;
			int y = 11;
			boolean f = x != y;
                        System.out.println(f);    f = true


3. Logical Operator: Logical operators are used to operate logical works. Logical operators are: &&, ||
                     
                     i. Logical And: Logical And returns true if both of the condition or expression is true, otherwise returns false.
                     ii. Logical Or: Logical Or returns true if only one condition or expression is true, otherwise returns false;

                     int a = 10; 
                     int b = 12;
                     int c = 15;
                     boolean f = (c >= a && c <= b)                 
                     System.out.println(f);   
		     boolean d = (c <= a || c <= b)
                     System.out.println(d);


4. Assignment Operator: Assignment operators are used to assign values in a variable. Assignment operators are: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

                       int value;
                       value = 10;
                       value += 5;     value = value + 5;
		       value -= 1;     value = value - 1;
		       value *= 2;     value = value * 2;
                       value /= 14;    value = value / 14
                       value %= 2;     value = value % 3
                       System.out.println(value);


                                         

6. Ternary Operator: ? :

		    int age = 18;
		    String result = age >= 18 ? "Voter" : "Not Voter";
                    System.out.println(result);



                    int age = 18;
                    if (age >= 18) {
                        System.out.println("Voter");
		    }
                    else {
			System.out.prinln("Not Voter");
                    }
