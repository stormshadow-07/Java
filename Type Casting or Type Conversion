                                                                Type Casting / Type Conversion





There are two types of Type Casting for Primitive Data Type. -> 1. Widening Type Casting / Implicit Type Casting / Automatic Type Casting
                                                                2. Narrowing/Shortening Type Casting / Explicit Type Casting / Manual Type Casting




1. Widening Type Casting: Widening Type Casting is also known as Implicit Type Casting or Automatic Type Casting. In this type of casting, the compiler automatically casts one data type to another data type.

            
                                          byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
                                           1b      2b       2b      4b     8b      4b        8b


2. Narrowing Type Casting: Narrowing Type Casting is also known as Explicit Type Casting or Manual Type Casting. In this type of casting, we have to manually convert values from one type to another type.

                                         double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
                                          8b         4b       8b     4b     2b       2b       1b
